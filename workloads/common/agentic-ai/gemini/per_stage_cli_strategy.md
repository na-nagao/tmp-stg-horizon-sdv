# Per-stage Gemini CLI runs (token budget mitigation)

## Context

Sequenced AI Review (`gemini_analysis.sh`) builds **composed prompts** for each step and appends **prior step output** as context. In **constrained** Gemini deployments, **total tokens per analysis** are capped. Any stage—**triage**, **RCA**, or **fix**—can approach or exceed limits when skills, workspace rules, and large `test-results/` excerpts accumulate in **one** long request chain.

## Proposal

Run **`gemini` / Gemini CLI** as **separate processes per stage** (“per agent”), not one unbounded multi-step conversation:

1. **Triage** — one invocation; write **`step1_output.md`** (and any allowed artifacts) to disk; **exit**.
2. **RCA** — new invocation; input = **RCA prompt** + **`step1_output.md`** (optionally **capped**, e.g. existing `GEMINI_STEP2_PRIOR_CONTEXT_BYTES` pattern).
3. **Fix** — new invocation; input = **fix prompt** + **`step1_output.md`** + **`step2_output.md`** (with caps if needed).

Each stage gets a **fresh context window** for that call. Handoff is **explicit file-based**, not an ever-growing single prompt.

## Benefits

- **Lower peak tokens per API call** than stuffing full history into one composed blob.
- **Isolation**: failure in RCA does not require redoing triage if **`step1_output.md`** is already persisted.
- **Clearer ownership**: triage vs RCA vs fix prompts and skills can be tuned **per stage**.

## Costs / risks

- **Orchestration** must guarantee step order, artifact paths, and failure propagation (Jenkins / Argo already stage-oriented in spirit).
- **Duplicate system overhead**: if every stage resends the **full** `skills.yaml`, token cost can **repeat**; mitigations include **stage-scoped** skills, slimmer SKILL.md per step, or shared static prefix minimization.
- **Information loss** if prior-step files are **over-summarized**; caps must balance **budget vs fidelity**.
- **Total cost** may rise or fall depending on duplication vs today’s single-chain truncation.

## Relation to current script

`gemini_analysis.sh` runs **one Gemini CLI process per sequenced step**, each with its own JSON output file (`headless_output_stepN_*.json`), and writes **`stepN_output.md`** from that JSON. Step 2 appends capped or full **`step1_output.md`**; step 3 appends **both** **`step1_output.md`** and **`step2_output.md`** (with optional `GEMINI_STEP3_PRIOR_STEP*_BYTES` caps). See **`docs/workloads/common/agentic-ai/gemini.md`** → **Sequenced analysis**. Remaining product work is **hard budgets**, observability, and policy—beyond what the shell script enforces.

## Experimental note

This strategy is an **experimental example** for discussion and implementation guidance; **it will evolve** in future releases. Broader **Agentic AI** work (per-stage token budgets, enforcement, observability) is platform scope beyond what the shell scripts in this repository enforce.

## Open questions

- Per-stage **skills** split vs one YAML (maintenance vs token duplication).
- **Structured** handoff (e.g. JSON summary + pointers to log paths) vs raw markdown only.
- Where **precheck** runs (shell before CLI vs policy in wrapper).
