# Gemini AI Assistant utility

Jenkins job that runs the Gemini AI assistant CLI against user-provided artifacts. You supply a command to fetch artifacts (e.g. from GCS) and a prompt file; the job runs the CLI in headless mode and archives the output.

## Parameters

- **GEMINI_ARTIFACTS_COMMAND** (required) – Command to populate the workspace with content to analyse (e.g. `gcloud storage cp -r gs://bucket/path/ .`).
- **GEMINI_PROMPT_FILE** (required) – Step 1 prompt file (upload only).
- **GEMINI_PROMPT_FILE_2** (optional) – Step 2 prompt file (upload). Required only for sequenced analysis; when set with step 1, runs two or three steps with context chaining (order matters). We do not ship single-prompt files.
- **GEMINI_PROMPT_FILE_3** (optional) – Step 3 prompt file (upload). For three-step sequenced analysis.
- **GEMINI_COMMAND_LINE** – Full Gemini CLI invocation (e.g. `gemini --yolo --output-format json`). To pin the model and avoid auto-routing to preview-only models, add `--model <model name>` (e.g. `--model gemini-2.5-pro`).
- **GEMINI_SKILLS_YAML** (optional) – Upload `skills.yaml` (file parameter, like prompts). When provided, the job decodes it and converts to `.gemini/skills/*/SKILL.md` before analysis. Use when prompts are uploaded so the job cannot auto-detect the prompt dir.

Prompts are provided only via upload; there are no workspace path parameters.

### Why `skills.yaml` and `gemini_skills_from_yaml.py` (not only `SKILL.md` files)

The Gemini CLI discovers skills under **`.gemini/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`**, with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and a Markdown body. You *could* maintain those directories by hand and skip the converter.

This repo uses **`skills.yaml` plus `gemini_skills_from_yaml.py`** because:

- **Single source of truth** – One file holds **global_constraints** (prepended to every skill) and all step skills. Shared rules are not duplicated or edited in three separate Markdown files.
- **Structured fields** – Per-skill `output_schema`, `system_instructions`, and descriptions stay explicit; the script appends **Expected Output Format** from `output_schema` consistently.
- **Automation** – `gemini_initialise.sh` runs the converter when `skills.yaml` is present (or when `GEMINI_SKILLS_YAML` is set), so `.gemini/skills/` is regenerated before each run with no manual copy step.
- **Upload-friendly jobs** – For this utility, **`GEMINI_SKILLS_YAML`** can be supplied as base64 or a path; generating the CLI layout from YAML is simpler than uploading three separate `SKILL.md` trees.

The CLI expects **one directory per skill**, not one monolithic `skills.md`. A single mega-file would still need splitting to match that layout; YAML keeps editing in one place while matching the expected on-disk shape.

## Artifacts

- `gemini-assist/*` – Analysis output (e.g. proposed fixes).
- `headless_output*.json` – Raw CLI output.
- `step1_output.md`, `step2_output.md`, `step3_output.md` – Extracted step outputs when using sequenced prompts.
- `gemini-client-error.zip` – Error report if the CLI fails.

## Offline analysis & prompt/skill iteration

Use this utility against archived artifacts from any pipeline — Build, CVD Launcher, CTS Execution — to analyse passes or failures without re-running the original job, and as a sandbox for prompt and `skills.yaml` development.

- **Pick your artifacts.** Set `GEMINI_ARTIFACTS_COMMAND` to fetch the archived workspace or `test-results/` of the run you want to investigate (success or failure). Examples:
  - `gcloud storage cp -r gs://${ANDROID_BUILD_BUCKET_ROOT_NAME}/Android/Tests/CVD_Launcher/<BUILD_NUMBER>/test-results/ .`
  - `gcloud storage cp -r gs://${ANDROID_BUILD_BUCKET_ROOT_NAME}/Android/Tests/CTS_Execution/<BUILD_NUMBER>/test-results/ .`
- **Pick the matching prompts** from the relevant pipeline's `prompt/sequenced/` directory (`step1_triage.txt` → `GEMINI_PROMPT_FILE`, `step2_rca.txt` → `_2`, `step3_fixes.txt` → `_3`) and its `skills.yaml` → `GEMINI_SKILLS_YAML`.
- **For Cuttlefish/virtual-device focus, always use the CVD Launcher prompts** (not the CTS Execution set). Their Phase 0 boot preflight classifies `CVD_STATUS` (`BOOT_OK` / `BOOT_FAILED` / `BOOT_UNKNOWN`) from artifact-only signals (`"status":"Running"` in host CVD JSON, `VIRTUAL_DEVICE_BOOT_COMPLETED` per guest), so the same prompts auto-route between the runtime-health lane and the boot-failure lane — covering CVD logs whether captured by CVD Launcher or by CTS Execution.
- **Iterate on prompts and skills.** Edit `step*_<role>.txt` or `skills.yaml` locally, re-upload, re-run against the same archived artifacts, and compare `step*_output.md` until happy — then promote the changes back into the source pipeline's `prompt/sequenced/`.
